The initial vision of this repo was to be a Github mirror of published [RIGIS Data](https://www.rigis.org/). The mechanics around and interest in that turned out to be not enough to be anyone's full-time project. We continue to see what we can do to collaborate on this data in the future. 

In the meantime, we thought it might be worthy to use this repo to collate links to GIS resources around the State of Rhode Island. In the near-term future, perhaps code samples and RI-specific GIS Projects.
